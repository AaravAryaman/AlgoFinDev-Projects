        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <h4>I am Aarav Aryaman and I study at IIT Kanpur, pursuing mechanical engineering. I have a keen interest in Finance and its components, to learn Coding and to improve upon my social and life skills. </h4>
        <p>I was born in Patna and raised in Mumbai. I received most of my schooling in Mumbai itself, had a little detour in the middle when I lived in Delhi for 3 years.
            I have always been academically decent with an interest in arts, music, and sports, as leisure activities.
        </p>
        <p>I have appeared in several olympiads and competitions, often clearing them at school level but without any luck at the later stages. My first and only such achievement came in 4th grade when i cleared MTSE at the national level and earned a ₹1500 cashprize. 
            Fast forward to class 10th, i got 98.4% and 97% in class 12th. Nothing very special in between. </p>
        <p>Between 10th and 12th i prepared for JEE. Quite some trouble it was. As time passed, my interest in studying continued to slip, partly due to the extended 'study-period' due to COVID. 
            But still, I think I did good enough, thanks to constant nagging from my mother and a lot of pracrice question papers. My concepts from the latter part of 12th are still dubious though. Anyway, here I am! IIT KANPUR!!</p>
        <p>So far, my first year has been quite good, an amazing campus life, good freinds, increased social interactions and playing sports (only leisurely thus far). 
            Got a decent enough CPI in the first sem. And the second sem is also in full roll. Looking forward to the rest of my time in the campus...</p>
